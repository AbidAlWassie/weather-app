# Weather App

Weather App built with Next.js helps you get notifications about current weather and find latest weather based on your region.

## Project Plans

We will implement these following features eventually.

- Real Time Weather based on region.
- Loading Animations using DaisyUI [Skeleton](https://daisyui.com/components/skeleton/)
- Store data in a json file then fetch tha data.
- Sign in users using [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)
- Store the user data in a database like postgres, etc.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deployment

- I've deployed this project on [Vercel](https://next-weather-app.vercel.app/).
- You can clone this repo and try deploying the backend to sites like [xata.io](https://xata.io/), [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com/), etc.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
